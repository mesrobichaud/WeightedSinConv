# WeightedSinConv
An adaptation of Harmonic Embeddings. 

### Contributions 

- Added pixel-wise weighted loss (loader/make_weight_map)
- Support for harmonic square wave approximations (sq_embeddings.py, sq_unet.py, sinconv/SquareConv)
- Easier pre-trained backbone integration: variants of unet in unet.py
